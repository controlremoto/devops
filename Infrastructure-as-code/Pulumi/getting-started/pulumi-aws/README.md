# Get Started with Pulumi & AWS

Pulumi's infrastructure-as-code SDK helps you create, deploy, and manage AWS containers, serverless functions, and infrastructure using programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, and Java, and markup languages like YAML. The Pulumi AWS provider packages and CLI help you accomplish all these within minutes.

For a quick example of how Pulumi deploys infrastructure on AWS, this tutorial takes you through the following steps to easily deploy a static website:

1. **Setting up and configuring Pulumi to access your AWS account.**
2. **Creating a new Pulumi project.**
3. **Provisioning a new AWS S3 bucket.**
4. **Adding an `index.html` file to the bucket and serving it as a static website.**
5. **Cleaning up your deployment by destroying the resources you've provisioned.**
